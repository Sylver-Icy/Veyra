---

## Core Systems

### Registration & Onboarding

#### How It Works

Players must register before using most commands. Registration is handled through the `!helloVeyra` command.

**Registration Process:**
1. Player uses `!helloVeyra`
2. Veyra asks "Wanna be frnds with me? (Yes/No)"
3. If "Yes": Player is registered with:
   - A new user record in the database
   - An empty wallet
   - 2× Bag of Gold (item ID 183) as a starter gift
   - 150 starting energy
4. A guided tutorial begins

**Tutorial Flow:**
The tutorial system (`tutorial_services.py`) guides new players through:

| State | Task | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| NOT_STARTED | - | Initial state |
| CHECK_WALLET | `!check wallet` | Learn to check your gold |
| PLAY | `!play` | Play the number guessing game |
| OPEN_SHOP | `/shop` | View the shop system |
| WORK | `!work <job>` | Perform your first job |
| COMPLETED | - | Tutorial finished |

**Technical Details:**
- User state stored in `users.tutorial_state` column
- Tutorial guards block commands until the current step is completed
- Tutorial can be bypassed by setting `tutorial_state = -1`

---

### Economy System

The economy is gold-based with multiple sources and sinks to maintain balance.

#### Gold Sources
- **Jobs:** Knight (40-90g), Digger (20g + lootboxes), Miner (25g + ores), Thief (10% steal)
- **Quests:** Delivery rewards (10-1200g based on rarity/streak)
- **Lootboxes:** Gold drops (3-500g based on tier)
- **Marketplace sales:** Sell items to other players
- **Shop buyback:** Sell items to the daily shop
- **Battle victories:** Winner takes 90% of total pot
- **Racing winnings:** Proportional payout from prize pool
- **Usable items:** Bag of Gold grants 100g
- **Campaign rewards:** Gold rewards for clearing stages

#### Gold Sinks
- **Shop purchases:** Buy items from daily shop
- **Marketplace purchases:** Buy from player listings
- **Battle bets:** Entry stakes for PvP
- **Racing bets:** Wagers on animal races
- **Transfer fees:** 5% fee on gold transfers
- **Marketplace fees:** 7% seller fee on sales
- **Building purchases:** Unlock/upgrade crafting buildings
- **Smelting costs:** Coal consumed during crafting

#### Key Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `add_gold(user_id, amount)` | Add gold to user's wallet |
| `remove_gold(user_id, amount)` | Remove gold (raises error if insufficient) |
| `check_wallet(user_id)` | Returns current gold balance |
| `get_richest_users(limit)` | Returns top N users by gold |

#### Leaderboard

A `/leaderboard` command shows the top 10 richest users. Weekly leaderboards are posted automatically every Sunday at midnight UTC.

#### Loan System

Players can take loans to get quick gold, with repayment required within a set term.

**Starter Loan:**
- One-time loan available to all players
- Amount: 2,000 gold
- Repayment: 2,000 gold (no interest)
- Term: 7 days
- Use `/loan` to take, `!repayloan` to repay

**Failure to Repay:**
- Hurts your credit score
- Locks you out of future loans
- DM reminders sent 2 days before due date

*Note: Additional loan types exist (Squire's Advance, Baron's Favor, etc.) with varying principal amounts, interest rates, and credit score requirements.*

---

### Inventory System

Players can collect, trade, and use items stored in their inventory.

#### Item Properties

Each item in the database (`items` table) has:

---

### Shop & Marketplace

Veyra features two distinct trading systems:  a bot-run **Shop** and a player-driven **Marketplace**.

#### Daily Shop

The shop rotates daily at midnight UTC with:
- **Sell Section:** 6 random items (Common/Rare/Epic) that players can buy
- **Buyback Section:** 5 items (Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary) that players can sell
  - The 5th item has a 1. 3-2. 2x bonus multiplier on its price

**Shop Pricing:**

| Rarity | Buy Price Range | Buyback Range |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Common | 5-10g | 5-10g |
| Rare | 15-22g | 15-22g |
| Epic | 50-70g | 50-70g |
| Legendary | 200-280g | 200-280g |
| Paragon | 600-900g | 600-900g |

**Shop Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/shop` | View today's shop (shows both sections) |
| `!buy <item> <qty>` | Purchase items from the sell section |
| `!sell <item> <qty>` | Sell items to the buyback section |

#### Player Marketplace

The marketplace allows players to create listings for other players to buy.

**How It Works:**
1. **Creating a listing:** Items are taken from your inventory and held in escrow
2. **Buying:** Buyer pays gold → seller receives 93% (7% fee) → buyer gets items
3. **Deleting:** Items are refunded to the seller's inventory

**Marketplace Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/create_listing` | List items for sale (max 4 active listings) |
| `/loadmarketplace` | Browse all active listings |
| `/buy_from_marketplace <id> <qty>` | Purchase from a listing |
| `/delete_listing <id>` | Remove your listing and refund items |

---

### Combat System

Veyra features a sophisticated turn-based combat system with PvP (1v1 battles) and PvE (campaign mode).

#### Battle Mechanics

**Core Stats:**

| Stat | Base Value | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| HP | 40 + weapon bonus | Health points; 0 = defeat |
| Attack | 5 + weapon bonus | Damage output |
| Defense | 10 + weapon bonus | Damage reduction percentage |
| Speed | 10 + weapon bonus | Turn order; affects block/counter success |
| Mana | 10 + weapon bonus | Required for casting spells |
| Frost | 0 | Accumulates; at 10, triggers 50% HP damage |

**Stances (Actions):**

Each round, players choose one of five stances:

| Stance | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Attack** | Deal damage based on Attack stat.|
| **Block** | Reduce incoming damage by 70%. Gain defense on success.  Fails if too slow.  |
| **Counter** | Reflect 50% of damage if opponent attacks. Penalties if wrong guess. |
| **Recover** | Regenerate HP or Mana (alternates). Only works if opponent is defensive. |
| **Cast** | Use your equipped spell (costs Mana). |

**Stance Interactions Matrix:**

| P1 \ P2 | Attack | Block | Counter | Recover | Cast |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|---------|------|
| Attack | Both deal damage (faster goes first) | P1 blocked | P1 countered | P2 interrupted, takes damage | P2 casts if faster |
| Block | P1 blocks P2 | Both lose 7 HP | P1: -2 HP, P2: -4 speed | P2 recovers, P1 loses defense | P2 casts |
| Counter | P2 countered | P1: -4 speed, P2: -2 HP | Both lose 10 defense | P2 recovers, P1 penalized | P2 casts |
| Recover | P1 interrupted | P1 recovers, P2 loses defense | P1 recovers, P2 penalized | Both fail | P2 casts |
| Cast | P1 casts | P1 casts | P1 casts | P1 casts | Faster caster wins; other loses 5 mana |

**Status Effects:**

| Effect | Duration | Per-Round Effect |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Nightfall | 5 rounds | Random stat reduced (attack: -1, speed: -1, mana: -2, hp: -3, defense: -5) |
| Large Heal | 4 rounds | Heal 4 HP per round |
| Frostbite | Accumulates | At 10 stacks: 50% current HP damage |
| Veil of Darkness | 4 rounds | Incoming attack damage reduced by 60% |

**Timeout Penalty:**
- If a player doesn't choose within 50 seconds:  -25 HP penalty
- Default action becomes "Attack"

#### PvP Battles

**Starting a Battle:**
```
/battle @opponent <bet_amount>
```

1.  Challenger's bet is deducted immediately
2. Target receives a challenge embed with Accept/Decline buttons
3. If accepted, target's bet is also deducted
4. Battle begins with alternating rounds
5. Winner receives 90% of total pot (10% Veyra fee)

**Loadout System:**
Players can customize their weapon and spell:
```
/loadout <weapon> <spell>
```

#### PvE Campaign

Campaign Mode is a solo progression system where players fight against AI opponents across 15 stages of increasing difficulty. Stages 1-10 feature Veyra as the opponent, while stages 11-15 introduce Bardok, a new challenging enemy. Each stage requires defeating the opponent to advance, with unique rewards granted upon completion.

**Starting a Campaign Battle:**
```
/campaign
```

**How Campaign Mode Works:**
- Players fight using their own loadout (weapon + spell)
- The opponent's loadout and stats are determined by your current campaign stage
- Combat uses the same turn-based mechanics as PvP battles
- Veyra (stages 1-10) and Bardok (stages 11-15) are controlled by AI that adapts strategy based on equipped weapons and your play patterns
- Defeat the opponent to advance to the next stage and claim rewards
- You cannot start a new campaign battle while already in an active battle

**Campaign Stages 1-10 (Veyra):**

| Stage | Veyra's Weapon | Veyra's Spell | Bonus HP | Bonus Mana |
|-------|----------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Training Blade | Fireball | -25 | -5 |

| 3 | Training Blade | Erdtree Blessing | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | Moon Slasher | Frostbite | +5 | 0 |
| 5 | Elephant Hammer | Erdtree Blessing | +5 | 0 |
| 6 | Eternal Tome | Nightfall | +10 | +5 |
| 7 | Training Blade | Heavyshot | +15 | +5 |
| 8 | Dark Blade | Fireball | +15 | 0 |
| 9 | Moon Slasher | Frostbite | +22 | +8 |
| 10 | Veyra's Grimoire | Veil of Darkness | +25 | +10 |

**Campaign Stages 11-15 (Bardok):**

| Stage | Bardok's Weapon | Bardok's Spell | Bonus HP | Bonus Mana | Special Mechanic |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------|------------|------------------|
| 11 | Bardok's Claymore | Nightfall | +10 | +5 | - |
| 12 | Bardok's Claymore | Earthquake | +15 | +15 | - |
| 13 | Bardok's Claymore | Earthquake | +5 | +5 | Gains attack if you repeat the same stance |
| 14 | Bardok's Claymore | Earthquake | +5 | +10 | Lava Arena: periodic fire damage |
| 15 | Moon Slasher | Fireball | +10 | +15 | Frozen Arena: ice effects |

**Campaign Rewards:**

| Stage | Reward |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | 40 Gold |
| 2 | 1× Wooden Box |
| 3 | 100 Gold |
| 4 | 250 Gold |

**Campaign Completion:**
- Upon completing Stage 10, you unlock access to Veyra's signature weapon and spell for use in PvP battles
- Upon completing Stage 15, you unlock Bardok's Claymore weapon and Earthquake spell
- Once Stage 15 is completed, attempting `/campaign` will display a completion message
- Campaign progress is saved per-user in the database

**Tips for Campaign:**
- Early stages are easier with weaker opponent stats (negative bonuses)
- Stage difficulty ramps up with opponents gaining HP/Mana bonuses
- Study opponent weapon effects to anticipate their strategy (e.g., Moon Slasher builds Frost)
- Bardok stages (11-15) introduce new mechanics like arena effects and stance penalties

  - Level 2: Tier 1-2 potions
  - Level 3: Tier 1-3 potions

#### Strain System

Using potions accumulates **strain** on your body:
- Each potion adds strain when consumed
- Strain value (0-100) equals % chance next potion use fails
- If a potion fails, it is wasted and has no effect
- Strain decays by 1 point every 25 minutes (scheduled decay)

**Strain Status Messages:**
- 0: "Your body feels normal. No lingering side effects remain."
- 1-10: "You feel mostly fine. A slight dizziness lingers, but another potion should be safe."
- 11-30: "Your head feels light and your body is warm. Drinking more might start to feel uncomfortable."
- 31-60: "Your stomach churns and your vision blurs slightly. Another potion could make things worse."
- 61-89: "You feel nauseous, weak, and unsteady. Drinking another potion is risky."
- 90+: "You are extremely sick. Your body is rejecting the toxins. Drinking another potion could make you faint."

**Commands:**
```
/brew <potion_name_or_id>   # Craft a potion
!use <potion_name>          # Use a potion
```
