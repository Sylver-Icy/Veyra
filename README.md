# ✨ Veyra — The Discord Bot That Does It All (WIP)

> Why settle for 10 bots... when you can have **one** that does it better?

Veyra’s a modular Discord bot I’m building with a bunch of fun, useful, and just plain chaotic features — like **moderation**, **economy**, **RPG**, and **cool minigames** — all running on a production-grade codebase.  
More features coming soon… because I can’t stop adding stuff T-T
